# Public folder

* `What is:` In a JavaScript project, the "public" folder is typically used to store static assets and files that are meant to be publicly accessible by the client-side code or the end-users of the application. It is a common convention in many frontend frameworks and build tools.

* The "public" folder usually contains assets such as:
1. `HTML Files:` The main HTML files of the application, like "index.html," "404.html," or other entry points.
2. `Images:` Static image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG, SVG) used in the user interface.
3. `Fonts:` Font files (e.g., TTF, WOFF, EOT) required for custom typography in the application.
4. `Favicons:` The favicon files used to represent the website in the browser's tab and bookmarks.
5. `Other Static Files:` Any other files that need to be accessed directly by the client-side code, like JSON files, XML files, etc.

* The purpose of the "public" folder is to hold these assets that don't require any processing or bundling by build tools. When you build your JavaScript application for production, these files are typically copied as-is to the output directory, and their URLs are directly accessible by the client-side code in the browser.

* For example, in a React application created with Create React App, you'll find a "public" folder containing the "index.html" file and other static assets. When you run the build command (npm run build), the assets from the "public" folder are copied to the build output directory (e.g., "build" folder), and the resulting application can be served by a web server or deployed to a hosting service.

* It's essential to put public assets in the "public" folder because these files are typically not processed by tools like Webpack or Babel and should be directly available to the browser for efficient loading and caching. Additionally, when using a frontend framework or build tool, it helps keep a clear distinction between the public assets and the source code that needs to be processed and bundled.

## Static Assets:
* Are files that are served to the client (browser) as-is without any server-side processing. These assets are typically fixed and don't change dynamically based on user interactions or requests. Common examples of static assets include images (PNG, JPEG, SVG, etc.), fonts (TTF, WOFF, EOT, etc.), CSS stylesheets, client-side JavaScript files, and other media files.

* Static assets are essential for building web applications because they contribute to the overall look, feel, and functionality of the user interface. When a user visits a website, the static assets are loaded by the browser and displayed to the user.
